# glyph_lang_patch_system
 a way of recording/displaying/planning/etc. synth patches


in a slightly comedic manner this didnt fully turn out as i had originally started imagin9ing when i had the original idea - g-petey kinda took it and ran with it in a way that wasn't fully mine and tho i love it it's not perfect yet so i kninda put it on the back burner a lil
someday something will definitely come of it tho iswear!
